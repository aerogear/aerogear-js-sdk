= Contributing to AeroGear JavaScript SDK

First, ensure you have the https://docs.npmjs.com/[latest npm] installed.

Then, to set everything up run in your terminal:
[source,bash]
npm install
npm run bootstrap

== Project Structure
The SDK is made by a group of modules, each one implemented in a different NPM package and all placed under `/packages`.

Each module provides an API to use a particular AeroGear service.

A main package called `core` contains a shared set of interfaces, classes and other functionalities that the rest of modules depend on.

== Working on modules

Modules are written in https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] and tested by https://mochajs.org/[mocha].

Once the development is done, the module is built and the source code is transpiled into a `dist/` folder and published. Typings are automatically generated during this step as well.

== Commands

Run this commands from the repo's root directory.

==== Run tests with coverage
[source,bash]
npm run test

==== Run linter
[source,bash]
npm run lint

==== Build
[source,bash]
npm run build

== Adding a new module

Create a new NPM package under the packages folder with the module name: `/packages/my-module`, using our link:../templates/package.json[package.json template].

Ensure to include the org scope to its name: `"name": "@aerogear/my-module"`.

Finally, add the following link:../templates/tsconfig.json[`tsconfig.json`].

== Publishing a module

== Showcase App

Testing can be done using the showcase application:

https://github.com/aerogear/ionic-showcase

The master branch of the linked showcase application will always use the latest released sdk packages. However,
if you wish to use the showcase application for SDK development then ensure you have linked the relevant packages locally as follows:
