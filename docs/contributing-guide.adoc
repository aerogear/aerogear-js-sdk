= Contributing to AeroGear JavaScript SDK

First, ensure you have the https://docs.npmjs.com/[latest npm] installed.

Then, to set everything up run in your terminal:
[source,bash]
npm install
npm run bootstrap

== Project Structure
The SDK is made by a group of modules, each one implemented in a different NPM package and all placed under `/packages`.

Each module provides an API to use a particular AeroGear service.

A main package called `core` contains a shared set of interfaces, classes and other functionalities that the rest of modules depend on.

== Working on modules

Modules are written in https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] and tested by https://mochajs.org/[mocha].

Once the development is done, the module is built and the source code is transpiled into a `dist/` folder and published. Typings are automatically generated during this step as well.

== Commands

Run this commands from the repo's root directory.

==== Run tests with coverage
[source,bash]
npm run test

==== Run linter
[source,bash]
npm run lint

==== Build
[source,bash]
npm run build

== Adding a new module

Create a new NPM package under the packages folder with the module name: `/packages/my-module`.

When creating the package.json, include the org scope to its package name: `"name": "@aerogear/my-module"`.

Then add the following standard options and dependencies:
[source.json]
{
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "types/index.d.ts",
  "author": "AeroGear <aerogear@googlegroups.com>",
  "keywords": [
    "aerogear",
    "mobile"
  ],
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "del coverage src/**/*.js src/**/*.map test/**/*.js test/**/*.map node_modules",
    "build": "tsc",
    "watch": "tsc --watch",
    "test": "nyc mocha"
  },
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
  "nyc": {
    "include": [
      "src/**/*.ts"
    ],
    "extension": [
      ".ts"
    ],
    "require": [
      "ts-node/register"
    ],
    "reporter": [
      "lcov",
      "text"
    ],
    "lines": 75,
    "functions": 100,
    "branches": 80
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/chai": "4.1.2",
    "@types/chai-as-promised": "7.1.0",
    "@types/mocha": "^5.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^9.4.6",
    "@types/proxyquire": "1.3.28",
    "@types/sinon": "^4.3.1",
    "browserify": "^16.2.0",
    "chai": "4.1.2",
    "chai-as-promised": "7.1.1",
    "del-cli": "1.1.0",
    "mocha": "^5.0.5",
    "nyc": "^11.6.0",
    "sinon": "^4.5.0",
    "source-map-support": "^0.5.4",
    "ts-node": "5.0.1",
    "typescript": "^2.8.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@aerogear/core": "0.1.0"
  }
}

Finally, add the following `tsconfig.json`:
[source.json]
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "include": [
    "src/"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "declarationDir": "./types"
  }
}
