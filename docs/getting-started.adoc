== Getting Started with AeroGear JavaScript SDK

This guide provides general information for creating applications that utilize the AeroGear JavaScript SDK.

== Prerequisites for Apache Cordova

In order to develop a Cordova application utilizing the SDK you will need the following prerequisites installed:

 * The link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] runtime and NPM
 * https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli[AeroGear Mobile CLI]
 * Apache link:https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#installing-the-cordova-cli[Cordova CLI]

== Installing the AeroGear JavaScript SDK

The services in the SDK are available as NPM packages under the `@aerogear` scope suffixed with a `<module name>-<platform>`.

The Core of the SDK along with suitable native module bindings, for example, is available as `@aerogear/core-cordova`.

=== Including native plugins on your Cordova project

In order to properly install the native dependencies of the SDK in your project, use the Cordova CLI instead of plain NPM to add them as plugins:

[source]
----
$ cordova plugin add @aerogear/core-cordova
Installing "core-cordova" for android
Android Studio project detected
Adding core-cordova to package.json
Saved plugin info for "core-cordova" to config.xml
----

This will link the native portions of the SDK code to your project, and allow Cordova to include them in the applications as they're built.

After running the above command, your project's `package.json` and `config.xml` should have been updated to include the new plugin:

* *package.json*:
[source, javascript]
----
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@aerogear/core-cordova": "1.0.0",
    // ...
  },
  "cordova": {
    "plugins": {
      "core-cordova": {}
    },
    // ...
  }
}
----

* *config.xml*:

[source, xml]
----
<widget id="org.aerogear.mobile.example.cordova" version="1.0.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets" xmlns:cdv="http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0">
    <!-- ... -->
    <plugin name="core-cordova" spec="1.0.0" />
</widget>
----


See the link:https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/platform_plugin_versioning_ref/#plugin-versioning[Apache Cordova documentation for Plugins] for more information.

== Adding the AeroGear Configuration file

Utilize the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli[AeroGear Mobile CLI] to generate a `mobile-services.json` file and place it inside your project's resource directory.

For a Cordova project, it should be placed in `www/mobile-services.json`.

== Using modules from the AeroGear JavaScript SDK in a Cordova project

After being correctly installed, the modules in the SDK will be available as properties in the global `window` object as `window.Mobile*` properties in a similar way to other Cordova plugins.

The following snippet from the link:../../example/cordova[Cordova Example App] showcases how to utilize methods from the `MetricsService` that's bundled with Core:

[source, javascript]
----
window.MobileCore.MetricsService.getMetrics(
  function (metrics) {
    $("#metrics-info").html(JSON.stringify(metrics));
  },
  function (error) {
    $("#metrics-info").html(error);
  }
);
----
