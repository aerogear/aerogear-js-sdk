# AeroGear React Native Demo

This is a small example app to demonstrate the features of the AeroGear SDK for react-native.


## Prerequisites

Make sure that npm and the react native CLI are installed on your system:

```
brew install npm
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Try it out

Make sure you have the 'core' package built first. See [../../docs/contributing-guide.adoc](../../docs/contributing-guide.adoc)

You can try the example by running:

```
# Install dependencies
# NOTE: This will also install a copy of the core sdk from ../../packages/core
#       Linking is not possible with react-native currently
npm install

# Run the app
react-native run-<platform>
```

where `<platform>` can be either `ios` or `android`.
